IT COULD BE AIRDROP!!!

Allow me to explain:

Traditionally, airdrops  are a marketing strategy that crypto projects employ to incentivize the use of their platform.

New projects may airdrop crypto into your wallet as part of an initial offering, or as a reward for promoting the brand.

Airdrops are a way to acquire digital currency without buying it, sounds unreal ?? I will give u an example:

Uniswap(Its is a famous cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol.) dropped an Airdrop potentially worth in excess of $3,300 USD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Who was eligible?
Any Ethereum wallet which has done one of the following before September 1, 2020:
One swap
Providing liquidity for any duration
Redeemed SOCKS token
Held one or more SOCKS tokens at the moment of the snapshot.

So ya, in conclusion all I can say is go support and use  the new web3 protocols and applications  and get rich overnightðŸ˜‚

 Also Check out the simple airdrop contract I made, it pretty self explanatory.
 
 
 bye now
